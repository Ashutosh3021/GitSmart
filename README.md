# RepoLens

*Because reading other people's code is overrated, let an AI do it instead.*

A modern, dark-themed web application for AI-powered GitHub repository analysis. Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. We're not saying you'll never have to read documentation again, but... actually, that's exactly what we're saying.

## ✨ Features

- **AI Explanation**: Get instant, natural language explanations of any codebase (finally, someone who can explain what that 10,000 line file actually does)
- **Repository Scoring**: Multi-dimensional /10 scoring across 6 key areas - because nothing says "I have opinions" like a arbitrary number
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Auto-generated architecture and workflow visualizations - pretty pictures for when words aren't enough
- **README Generator**: AI-powered README creation with live markdown preview - now with 100% less "I'll write it later" syndrome
- **Chat with Repository**: Ask questions and get contextual answers about the code - it's like having a developer who actually responds to your questions
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment instructions for multiple platforms - so you can finally deploy that side project that's been sitting in your drafts
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol integration configuration - sounds fancy, works great
- **Security Audit**: Automated security analysis (coming eventually, we promise)

## 🎨 Design System

*"Dark mode is not a preference, it's a lifestyle."*

- **Background**: #0a0a0f (Deep dark - so dark your code editor will feel inadequate)
- **Primary Accent**: #00e5ff (Cyan - for that futuristic "I definitely know what I'm doing" vibe)
- **Secondary**: #7c3aed (Purple - because why choose between looking cool or productive when you can do neither?)
- **Typography**: 
  - Headings: Syne (for when you need to seem artistic)
  - Code/Labels: JetBrains Mono (for pretending you're a serious developer)
- **Features**: Glassmorphism cards, subtle grid background, glowing borders - basically CSS magic tricks

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

*Or as seasoned developers call it: "that thing I do before actually reading the documentation."*

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (yes, you need to update)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison)

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd my-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

*Pro tip: If it doesn't work on the first try, that's completely normal.*

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - if you see errors, congratulations, you're a real developer now.

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Start
npm start
```

*Warning: The build process will reveal all the TypeScript errors you were conveniently ignoring in development.*

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Pages

1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - Hero with animated tagline
   - GitHub URL input with prefix (because typing "github.com/" is apparently too much work)
   - Feature cards grid (8 features, because one blog post wasn't enough)
   - How it works flow (6 steps - we're basically a tutorial now)
   - GitHub OAuth login button

2. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Sidebar with repo stats (stars, language, commits, contributors)
   - 7 tabs: Overview, Score, Diagrams, README, Chat, Deploy, MCP
   
3. **Settings** (`/settings`)
   - GitHub OAuth connection status
   - API key management for AI providers (your money, your keys)
   - Model selection per provider
   - Memory management (chat history - because AI has short memory too)
   - Theme toggle (dark only for now - light mode users, we're not sorry)

### Components

- **Navbar**: Fixed navigation with logo, OAuth status, settings link
- **RepoCard**: Repository information card
- **ScoreDial**: Animated radial dial showing /10 score - the number that will haunt your dreams
- **ScoreBar**: Linear progress bars for score breakdown
- **MermaidRenderer**: Renders architecture and workflow diagrams
- **ChatBubble**: Message bubbles with markdown support
- **ChatInput**: Input field with send button
- **CodeBlock**: Syntax-highlighted code with copy button (you're welcome, lazy developers)
- **BadgeStrip**: Shields.io-style badges for README
- **ProviderSelector**: AI provider dropdown with model selection

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router) - because App Router is apparently the future
- **Language**: TypeScript - making JavaScript slightly less terrifying since 2012
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - for when you want to look productive but actually just want to argue about utility classes
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui - borrowing code is a skill, not a flaw
- **Animation**: Framer Motion - making things move because static websites are so 2015
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js - flowcharts for people who can't draw
- **Markdown**: react-markdown, remark-gfm - making text look like code since forever
- **Icons**: Lucide React - these icons are actually pretty good, no sarcasm intended

---

## 📝 Key Features Implementation

### Glassmorphism Design
```css
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(15, 15, 25, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
}
```
*It's basically just seeing through your code, literally.*

### Cyan Glow Effects
- Primary accent: `#00e5ff`
- Glow shadows with opacity
- Focus states with cyan rings

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl
- Sidebar hidden on mobile
- Stacked tabs on small screens

---

## 🔌 Backend Integration Points

*For when you want to actually make this thing work in production.*

The application is built with mock data and ready for backend integration:

1. **Repository Analysis API**
   - Endpoint: `/api/analyze`
   - Accepts: GitHub repository URL
   - Returns: Analysis data, scores, diagrams
   - Warning: May require actual API keys, sorry

2. **AI Chat API**
   - Endpoint: `/api/chat`
   - Streaming responses supported (eventually)
   - Memory management for context

3. **Authentication**
   - GitHub OAuth integration
   - JWT token storage
   - Private repository access

4. **AI Providers**
   - Google Gemini (recommended, it's "free" until it isn't)
   - OpenAI (GPT-4)
   - Anthropic Claude
   - Groq (fast, cheap, what's the catch?)

---

## 🎯 Customization

### Adding New Features

1. Create component in `components/` or `components/dashboard-tabs/`
2. Add route/page in `app/` if needed
3. Update navigation in `components/navbar.tsx`
4. Add tab in dashboard if applicable

*Easy, right?*

### Modifying Colors

Edit `app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --cyan: #00e5ff;
  --purple: #7c3aed;
  /* ... other colors - have fun with that */
}
```

### Changing Fonts

Update `app/globals.css`:
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Your+Font&display=swap');

:root {
  --font-syne: 'Your Font', sans-serif;
}
```

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- **Mock Data**: All data is currently mocked - your results may vary, just like your code quality
- **No Real AI**: Chat responses are hardcoded - at least it's consistent
- **No Backend**: No actual API integration - you're on your own, champ
- **Static Export**: Ready for static deployment - not ready for production, probably
- **Rate Limits**: GitHub API has rate limits - behave or wait

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Set up API routes in `app/api/`
   - Implement GitHub API integration
   - Add AI provider SDKs

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement NextAuth.js
   - GitHub OAuth provider
   - Protected routes

3. **Database**
   - Add PostgreSQL or MongoDB (or don't, SQLite works fine)
   - Store chat history
   - Cache analysis results

4. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket for chat streaming (maybe)
   - Live analysis progress (probably not)
   - Real-time notifications (definitely not)
